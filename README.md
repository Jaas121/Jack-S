Welcome 👋

Hey — thanks for checking out my repository!

This space contains a collection of projects I began in November 2024, during my summer break. Most of the work here explores topics in finance and finance-adjacent fields, ranging from data analysis and visualisation to quantitative modelling and algorithmic experiments.

I’m using these projects to sharpen my skills, explore ideas, and build out a portfolio of practical, technical work. Feel free to explore, fork, or reach out with suggestions!
